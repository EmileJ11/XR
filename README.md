## Game Modes

### Guess the Angle

In this mode, players are required to determine the direction from which a sound is emanating. You'll hear a sound, and your goal is to guess the angle relative to your position. This tests your ability to localize sound sources in a 360-degree environment.

### Guess the Distance

This mode focuses on your ability to judge how far away a sound is. You'll hear a sound, and you need to estimate the distance between you and the sound source. This mode enhances your perception of sound depth and distance.

## Requirements

- **Meta XR Audio SDK:** This project leverages the Meta XR Audio SDK to create realistic and immersive sound experiences.
- **Headphones:** To fully experience the 3D audio effects and accurately play the game, it is essential to use headphones.
- **Development Environment:** Ensure you have a suitable environment set up to run projects using the Meta XR Audio SDK, Windows is recommended.
